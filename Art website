<p><pre>
Years ago, I have been wanting to fly
But my wings were not ready to fly
They were growing
But the growth was slow
They were still the baby wings
Prodtrudding the middle of my body
Years after
They growing long and into shape
But I didn't know how to fly
High and fast and steady
frinds and families came with guidance
Motivation and effors paid me the skills 
Now I can fly I think
But I havent flown yet
Because my wings
They are tied by a rope
Of a powerful curse
Termed as refugee by other people
My teacher told me I have an R
Stamped permanently on my small forehead
This powerful curse
I've tried to break
With all the strength and wits
But to no avail
But I believe somebody out there
More fortunate than myself
Has the strength and the wit
I beg you to come to my help
And free me and erase this ungly R
To allow me to fly
Above the sky and below the land
And deep within the seas and the world
You'll by my Savor
For making a free bird
Peace to you, my Savior!
But my Savior, you haven't arrived yet
And I am still
